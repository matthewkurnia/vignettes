SCHO_LVL1_1,"Hello, little one. You are unfamiliar with this place, are you not?"
SCHO_LVL1_2,...
SCHO_LVL1_3,The silent type. I see.
SCHO_LVL1_4,"Er.. Apologies, my words have preceded my manners."
SCHO_LVL1_5,I am known as The Scholar. It is my purpose to accumulate knowledge about all things.
SCHO_LVL1_6,"If your question is where is this place, well that knowledge is beyond all of our kind. Even me."
SCHO_LVL1_7,"Often this place is called names such as ""Void"" or ""Limbo"", But I detest verbose words that has no meaning."
SCHO_LVL1_8,"You were always her favorite, little one. Shame she brought this upon you too."
SCHO_LVL1_9,Your journey ahead shall be perilous. I shall observe your voyage with great interest.
SCHO_LVL1_10,"Godspeed, little one."
SCHO_LVL2_1,The trial is different for all of us. Mine was of knowledge.
SCHO_LVL2_2,"I have read and memorized a hundred-thousand books, and yet I remember so few."
SCHO_LVL2_3,You see now why I am perpetually reading. I must do so lest I lose my intelligence
SCHO_LVL2_4,"The trial never ends for any of us. You think you've reached your destination but you have not, cannot, will not reach it."

SCHO_LVL2_6,The road ahead is more treacherous yet.
SCHO_LVL2_7,"Some doors shall be locked, and you shall open them."
SCHO_LVL2_8,Godspeed.
MUSC_1,Who has disturbed me?
MUSC_2,"Ah, it is you. The favorite."
MUSC_3,...
MUSC_4,No response. I suppose you were designed that way.
MUSC_5,I did not think she will give up on you.
MUSC_6,I guess I was mistaken.
MUSC_7,They call me the musician. None of us have names you see.
MUSC_8,"I suppose you've met the scholar. He is the eldest of all of us, he was here when she played her first song."
MUSC_9,Years has passed since I heard her playing. I guess she lost passion.
MUSC_10,"I, however, will not. I shall practice until my performance is without fault."
MUSC_11,Distract me again and I'll have your head on a platter.
MUSC_12,Now go.
